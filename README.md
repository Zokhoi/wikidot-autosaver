# Wikidot Autosaver
 A simple script that auto-saves to wikidot.
 This script requires login to wikidot via CLI to work.

 ------
 ### Dependencies and starting the script
 This script requires Node v8 or above to work as it uses async/await. Install other dependencies with
 ```sh
 npm i
 ```
 Start the script with
 ```sh
 node index.js
 ```
 in command line.

 ----
 ### Config
 Set up [config.yml](./config-example.yml) or [config.json](./config-example.json) and rename as `config.yml` or `config.json` with the following options:

 * `site`: `Array` of `String` indicating what wikidot sites you are going to save to. <br/>
 e.g. `["scp-sandbox-3", "wanderers-sandbox"]` means that you are going to save to `http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com` and `http://wanderers-sandbox.wikidot.com`.
 * `source`: `String` indicating the folder path where all your wikidot files are located.
 * `pages`: `String` or `Array` of `String` indicating the pages you want to save to wikidot:
  * `*` indicates you want to save all existing files in the under the site folder to wikidot;
  * `"page-name"` indicates you want to save only the specified _page-name_ to wikidot;
  * `["page-name-1", "page-name-2"]` indicates you want to save only _page-name-1_ and _page-name-2_ to wikidot.


----
### Autosave Folder Structure
The script auto-generates folders named with sites specified in the config in the folder specified source folder path. <br />
e.g. if you want to save to `scp-sandbox-3` page `a`, and to `wanderers-sandbox` pages `b:c` and `e`, <br />
`config.yml`:
```yaml
site:
  - "scp-sandbox-3"
  - "wanderers-sandbox"
source: "D:/Wikidot/"
pages:
  scp-sandbox-3: "*"
  wanderers-sandbox:
    - "b~c"
    - "e"
```
or equivalently `config.json`:
```json
{
  "site": ["scp-sandbox-3", "wanderers-sandbox"],
  "source": "D:/Wikidot/",
  "pages": {
    "scp-sandbox-3": "*",
    "wanderers-sandbox": [
      "b~c",
      "e"
    ]
  }
}
```
Then the folder structure in `D:/Wikidot/` can be:
```
.
├──scp-sandbox-3
|   └──a.txt
├──wanderers-sandbox
|   ├──b~c.txt
|   ├──d.txt
|   └──e.txt
```
And `d.txt` will not be saved to wikidot. <br />
Note that colons are converted into tildes, as colons are forbidden symbols for file names in Windows.

----
### File Content Structure
The file that you save should be of the following content structure:
```
title: (your title here)
tags: (tags here)
parent: (full parent page name here)
comments: (revision comment here)
~~~~~~
(your page source here)
```
or with YAML front matter:
``` yaml
---
title: (your title here)
tags: (tags here)
parent: (full parent page name here)
comments: (revision comment here)
---
(your page source here)
```
Any of title, tags, parent and comment are optional but are suggested to be kept even if they are empty, for your own ease.
